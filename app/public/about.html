            <p>This visualization was created with the goal of best informing the viewer on the way their representatives vote. The nodes that create the outer circle are members of the House of Representatives or the Senate and are colored 
                according to the left and right leanings of the members (dw nomination value). Each of the congressmen or women get a light colored connection (based on party) if they voted. These connections can be connected to the bill itself, an industry, or 
                their party. When connecting to a party or an industry node, the connection keeps its light color, but if the connection is directly to the bill it represents the vote of that individual, in which case the connection is colored red, being 
                nay, or green, being yea. </p>
            <p>The industry and party nodes represent the collective votes of groups of people, and they are present only when a majority of the members of the party or beneficiaries of an industry cast the same vote. The industry nodes are colored according
                to the political leanings of those influenced by the industry, and the color of the party node is simply the color of the party in real life. The size of both the industry and party nodes are determined in part by the number of members influenced 
                for the vote, but it is important to note that the party nodes will be bigger than industry nodes by default. The connections from these nodes to the center are indicative of those that are connected to that node. For example, if an industry
                has a red connection to the center, then all the members of congress that are connected voted no on the bill. The same goes for party.</p>
            <p>You can zoom on the graph as well as click on nodes in order to explore the visualization.</p>
            <p>Have fun.</p>
